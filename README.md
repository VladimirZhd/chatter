# Overview

In this project I was trying to learn more about Firebase and it's capabilities. I've used firebase with react to build a live time chat app. Using firebase was surprisingly exiting for me. I like jow their SDK has everything I need to use for my app. I implemented registration for users and login capabilities.

I always wanted to do something similar using node server and socket.io library. When I learned that I can build a chat using firebase without external libraries and backend server, I've decided to take another shot of learning firebase.
