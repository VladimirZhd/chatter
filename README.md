# Overview

In this project I was trying to learn more about Firebase and it's capabilities. I've used firebase with react to build a live time chat app. Using firebase was surprisingly exiting for me. I like jow their SDK has everything I need to use for my app. I implemented registration for users and login capabilities.

I always wanted to do something similar using node server and socket.io library. When I learned that I can build a chat using firebase without external libraries and backend server, I've decided to take another shot of learning firebase.

# Cloud Database

I used firebase/firestore in this project. With three simple collections and one sub collection to store messages. Also, I've used firebase/storage to store images that sent through messages and avatar images.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as IDE. For the front end work I used React.js and firebase SDK for web applications. To navigate in the SPA I used `react-router-dom` library, and to format the time I used `react-moment` library.

# Future Work

-   I want to make preview for images that users are going to send
-   Implement friend requests, so random people wouldn't message everyone
-   Add group chats
